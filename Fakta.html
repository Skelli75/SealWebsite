                    <p>Delve into the captivating world of pinnipeds, the fin-footed marine mammals that include seals, sea lions, and walruses. Seals, specifically true seals or phocids, are remarkable creatures adapted to life in both polar and temperate waters. With over 30 species inhabiting oceans worldwide, these marine mammals boast diverse characteristics and behaviors. Seals are well-known for their streamlined bodies, insulated blubber, and distinctive flippers, which aid in efficient swimming and diving. As expert hunters, seals exhibit an incredible array of feeding strategies, from the leopard seal's prowess as an apex predator to the agile harbor seal's coastal foraging habits. Remarkably versatile, seals can navigate icy environments in the Arctic and Antarctic, as well as bask on sun-soaked shores in more temperate regions.</p>
